---Proxy table for reading synced global state in unsynced code.
---
---**Generally not recommended.** Instead, listen to the same events as synced
---and build the table in parallel
---
---Unsynced code can read from the synced global table (`_G`) using the `SYNCED`
---proxy table. e.g. `_G.foo` can be access from unsynced via `SYNCED.foo`.
---
---This table makes *a copy* of the object on the other side, and only copies
---numbers, strings, bools and tables (recursively but with the type
---restriction), in particular this does not allow access to functions.
---
---Note that this makes a copy on each access, so is very slow and will not
---reflect changes. Cache it, but remember to refresh.
