---Handle for a data model.
---
---It is a wrapper around the model table, marked as type T.
---You can access fields by using normal indexing, but for the moment, the only keys that work are strings. Any index done this way will automatically trigger a rerender.
---If you need to index any tables or subtables by anything not a string, you will need to use the underlying table, gotten with `__GetTable`. This will not trigger a rerender.
---To trigger a rerender manually, use `_SetDirty`, passing in the name of the top-level entry in your model table that you edited.
